Webapp based on Django to manage personal finances

## Demo
There is a [demo](https://demo.silverstrike.org/) available.
It is regularly updated from the master branch.

## Get SilverStrike running on your machine

The easiest way to deploy SilverStrike is to clone this repository and use the provided docker-compose file. Check out you own branch so you can persist your configuration. 
You need to set a SECRET_KEY and should update the domain names and then you can start it up. 
You can generate yourself a random secrety key by running `python -c 'from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())'`

After starting the container, you should create yourself a user account
`docker-compose exec -it ags python manage.py createsuperuser`

To update SilverStrike simply fetch the changes from GitHub and rebuild your container.

By default sqlite is used which should be enough for a local installation. If you'd rather use postgresdb or mariadb you can uncomment the relevant parts in the docker-compose.

In the deploy directory you can find a couple of files:
- **nginx.conf** minimal nginx configuration for a reverse proxy setup
- **local_settings.py** Use this file to override any of the settings found in `settings.py`
- **demo_middleware.py** If you want to use some kind of external authentication you could use this as a starting point

## Branding

SilverStrike is abbreviated as AgStrike or simply AgS. SilverStrike is pronounced AgS or SilverStrike.
An alternative way of writing SilverStrike is `silverstrike` with no capital letters. Abbreviations have to be written as mentioned here.
